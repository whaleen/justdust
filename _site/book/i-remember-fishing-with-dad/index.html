      <p>I Remember Fishing with Dad, is a story of a father, Jason, who takes his son, Ethan, on his first fishing trip. While waiting for the fish to bite, Jason tells Ethan about a time when Jason was a boy, and how he and his own father competed in a salmon fishing derby. Jason recalls how he discovered that day that the most important thing wasn’t winning the derby, but spending time with his dad. During the course of the story, Ethan learns this same lesson. I Remember Fishing with Dad reminds parents who read this book to their children of how important it is to spend time with their children, making memories that will last a lifetime.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Every image that Jason Dorsey paints is radiant with gratitude — especially a deep thankfulness for family and a contagious enthusiasm for creation. While his memory for detail is impressive, his capacity to capture and reflect the light and colors of Pacific Northwest mornings will be a gift to every reader.” ~Jeffrey Overstreet, author of Auralia’s Colors</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jason Dorsey has written a good book on fishing. His message goes beyond fishing to a deep desire to see men reconnect with their children. He has seen the tragic impact of missing Dads and offers this enjoyable story to help fathers turn their hearts back to their children and families. Read it, and then go fishing with your children; or mountain biking or hiking or… May the Lord turn your heart toward your children.” ~Russ Pulliam, Indianapolis Star and World magazine contributor</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jack Dorsey and son, Jason, have collaborated on a sincere expression of ‘just going fishing’ together. Through their beautiful watercolor illustrations and heartfelt words, readers can’t help but be connected to their own special childhood memories with Dad.”
~Thomas William Jones, noted American watercolor artist</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This enchanting story carries the reader back to childhood on a voyage evocative with the exquisite watercolor illustrations of a father and son, Jack and Jason Dorsey. This book has already become a classic in our family, to be reread and paintings enjoyed repeatedly.” ~Dr. Anita Deyneka, A Family for Every Orphan, Board of Directors and author of books about children in Russia</p>
