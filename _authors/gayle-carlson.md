Biography: Gayle A. Carlson is a graduate of Covenant Bible College, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada. She is a mother of seven grown children, all home-schooled, and has twelve grandchildren. Gayle is a member of The Eugene Christian and Missionary Alliance Church where she has played organ and piano for over 29 years, developed the church library and served in various outreach ministries. She is employed full-time as a facility manager, part-time as a self-employed piano instructor, and resides in Eugene, Oregon. The beauty of Oregon, from its green gardens to picturesque coastline, is her palette of inspiration for poetryâ€”not just a hobby, but the demonstration of a love affair with God, and with words.
