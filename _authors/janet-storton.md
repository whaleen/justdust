Biography: Janet Storton grew up in the large naval town of National City, California, where her earliest classmates came from around the world. Through these relationships, she learned a respect for other cultures as they shared with her their various ethnic traditions. For her, global citizenship was her first nation.

Janet was drawn to Africa when she was only ten. Listening to a missionary couple speak at Sunday school set her heart toward service there, however it was not until 2007 that she went on her first missions trip to Uganda. She continues to travel there two or three times a year.

Janet lives in Sisters, Oregon with her husband of 44 years. There she teaches quilting and works tirelessly raising funds for the entrepreneurial programs that she has started in Uganda.
