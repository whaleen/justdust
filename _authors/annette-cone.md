Annette Friesen Cone is a native Oregonian.  She attended Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky, earning a degree in Elementary Education.  She taught 6th grade in Raleigh, North Carolina, and 4th grade in Albany, Oregon, where she also taught 3rd and 4th grade music and directed several all-school programs.  She taught music in Elmira and Noti schools in Oregon.  She received a Masters' in Education, as well as a Reading Endorsement from the University of Oregon.  

Annette has enjoyed the positions of church pianist, choir director, as well as writing and directing many musical programs for her church.  She and her husband, Greg, have four beautiful daughters.

Annette began writing the With God  series on the plane trip home from Africa.  She describes her thoughts as "spilling out onto the paper" as fast as her hand could write.  Bible verses came to mind that she didn't remember she knew.  Clearly, this was the answer to the prayer, "What will I do when my girls are grown and leave home?"  With God is how Annette does life.  She is constantly reminded of His presence with her.  He is her strength, her friend, her eternity.
