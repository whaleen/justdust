M. Kay Beckham graduated from Linfield College with degrees in English and Communications. Years later, while raising her family, she took her first calligraphy class at a local craft store. She discovered she could use art to communicate words more effectively. Studying with internationally known calligraphers Timothy Botts and Reggie Ezell honed her skills, while adding drawing and watercolor broadened them.  

Kay is a member of the Valley Calligraphy Guild, the Pacific Rim Art Guild, and the Watercolor Society of Oregon. She teaches at a local Christian high school and lives in Creswell, Oregon with her husband and near her three daughters and four grandchildren. Hiking, backpacking, and kayaking take her into nature where she finds the inspiration for her illustrations.
