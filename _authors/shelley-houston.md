summary: "The neighbor woman held her tea in both hands as she listened to Shelley L. Houston talk of things that mattered to her. The woman put her tea down. “Shelley, you're too intelligent to be a full-time mom. Why don't you put the kids in daycare and go back to doing something important?”  “But I am,” Shelley smiled."

Thirty years later Houston is both grateful and glad for the choice she made to raise her children who are successful adults, but more importantly, great friends. However, when the nest was empty, she dove into areas she had never dreamed.

Bolstered by a husband who delights in pleasing her, Houston completed a degree in business with a focus on organizational management. This degree and an internship enabled her to form a non-profit for private school development and a year later accept the position as executive director for a small Christian college in Bend, Oregon. There, she was tasked with developing a fully accredited liberal arts program for the fledgling college.  After completing this process, Houston moved back to Eugene to be closer to elderly parents and begin a professional career in writing—a long loved passion.

Copious hours in front of the computer resulted in regular articles and editorials in magazines, on blogs, and in newspapers. A few years into non-fiction writing, a friend challenged her to write a novel. Although Houston had previously spurned the idea, she began the task as a lark. Soon she realized that fiction writing had its own special appeal.

Twelve years later the novel was ready for publication, as was Houston ready for the next level of her career—fiction publishing. In seeking to find the right publisher, Houston entered her novel, Julia, Coming Home, in two publisher-sponsored writing competitions. Julia placed in both.

However, after talking with publishers she realized the publishing world was in a state of flux due to the struggling economy and the rise in popularity of the e-book. Publishers were interested, but unwilling to take a chance on a new author.

Houston briefly considered paying someone to publish her book, but then learned of a new venue that would change her life—becoming a publisher herself. And so, Just Dust Publishers was born in 2011.

Just Dust Publishers, JDP, has since published three of Houston's novels, three other authors' books, and is currently in contract with four authors to publish their books by the end of 2014.

Shelley L. Houston moved with her husband to McMinnville, Oregon, in 2014 to be closer to their grandchildren. While JDP sets up shop there, “Grammy” continues to make time for her grandchildren, of whom she hopes to become the best of friends.
