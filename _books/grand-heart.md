Grand Heart is a collection of 31 poems with the anchoring entry being Gayle Carlson's poem, "Grand Heart." Each meditative poem is matched with passages from the Bible and a summarizing application for the reader. Grouped into themes of the four seasons, these poems are designed to comfort, challenge, encourage, and inspire deeper worship. Water-color art enhances, uplifts, and delights, making this volume a fully-faceted inspiration for each day.

> "The poems of Grand Heart—grouped into the four seasons—should provide a spiritual boost for any reader seeking to be closer to the Lord. Each page begins with a challenging thought and a verse or two of related Scripture to introduce the idea for the day. Then, in luminous lines of beauty and wisdom, Gayle Carlson views God’s stunning creation and connects what she sees, hears, feels, tastes, and smells to a deeper meaning that nourishes both mind and spirit." — Ann Applegarth lives and writes in Roswell, New Mexico, where she served as poet-in-residence for the High Plains Writing Project at Eastern New Mexico University and where she teaches poetry classes to adults and children. The recipient of an Academy of American Poets prize at the University of New Mexico in 1980, her poems have been widely published in the small press and in online journals.

> “It was following the morning service and festivities that were both a farewell and retirement event after 40 years of pastoral ministries. I had returned later to the church study and discovered the handwritten “Pastor” poem signed and dated by Gayle on my desk.
My beginning scan soon became a careful repeated reading; wanting to savor the apt phrases of understanding that caught the incredible privilege and impossible burden that I had known in the years of speaking for God.
It was and remains a keen delight to me, but not a surprise. For over a decade my collection of Gayle’s poems had grown along with my recognition of her gift with words to strike to the heart of a matter.
I also learned that in the making of poems is also the making of the poet. A way with words may be a gift; but knowing the heart of matters is not. That comes from life intensely lived in the wide range of joy, love, beauty, faith as well as grief, loss, suffering, and more. It has been my privilege to have seen a small part of the making of each.
So, it is a pleasure to know that Gayle’s poems will now have a wider reading; it is also a pleasure to commend poems and poet both.” - Jay Johnson, Former Beloved Pastor of the Eugene Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, Eugene, Oregon, now retired.
