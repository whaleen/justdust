summary:
---

The Wisdom of Hope fashions ancient proverb, sage quotes, astute observations, and acumen into a sensitive book of beauty and anticipation. Beckham has woven together calligraphy and watercolors in this artistic book whose thoughts spans the ages, but are as welcome as this morning.

Beckham's original paintings well reflect the sumptuous wine country of Oregon as well as a few creatures that dwell there. It is a lovely book created for thought and reflection, but most certainly it is best described as a gift of courage to those who may have lost hope.
