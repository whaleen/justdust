Shaped By The Land is a compilation of the best stories from Bing Bingham's web column. These are the tales locals swap over an endless cup of coffee in an imaginary cafÃ© of a tiny farm and ranch town, deep in the rural American West.

> "Shaped by the Land is like a rolling record...no pretense...of imagined sounds, crusty truths and obvious choices. I recommend this book." - Lynn Miller, author of Farmer Pirates and Dancing Cows and Old Man Farming
