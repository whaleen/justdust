The characters of "Julia, Coming Home" return in, "A Father's Child," the second in The Remington House Series.

Willow has traveled through Europe, opened a restaurant, found her birth mother, and cheated death-all by the age of twenty-four. This capable young woman is now determined to find her biological father, certain that in doing so she will also know his love.

The story begins at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in the mountain town of Sage Meadows, Oregon; weaves a path through Denver and London; and concludes in Paris. Willow's search for her father brings relational dramas and an international intrigue which she could never have foreseen.
