Travelling in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul, author Annette Friesen Cone explores the ancient roads of Greece, Macedonia, Crete, Ephesus, and Rome. Her personal photos and first-hand experiences, combined with applied biblical scripture lead the reader to a fresh understanding of God’s Word. Thirty-one chapters, plus extra ideas for Bible study and introspection, make this book ideal for a month of discovery and inspiration.  Strap on your mental first century sandals and explore these ancient paths in your quest for a deeper knowledge of God.

Annette comments, “The inspiration for this book came from a Journeys of Paul tour taken in the fall of 2014. My husband and I travelled with our local church community, learning and experiencing—on site—the ministry of the Apostle Paul. I must admit that I truly came to like Paul as I viewed the roads on which he walked, the prisons that held him, and imagined him turning the world upside down. He and his friends spread the fire of their testimony abroad: that Christ has come and offers grace and forgiveness of the sins for all who believe.

This is Cone’s second book in the “With God” series. Her first, With God…on a Tanzanian Safari, was published in 2014. Slated for release in 2016 are With God…through French Doors and With God…through an Irish Window.

What others are saying:
"Annette is skilled by our LORD with a unique ability to sit in the truth of a text and marry it to the culture of our day. In doing so she allows the Word of God to come alive!  She is a 'treasure in an earthen vessel.'"
~Pastor Christopher Metcalf, Lihue Baptist Church, Hawaii.

"Travel through the pages of Annette's book and be refreshed with Word wisdom, cultural insight, and beautiful photographs; be reminded that God walks your today-path too; be drawn closer to Him. This second book in the "With God" series is my favorite, so far. I cheer you on, Annette. Yippee!!!"
