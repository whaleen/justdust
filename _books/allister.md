Allister lives life on the edge with the young he-mice of McAllister Elementary School's hidden community. From a game of Chicken with the school cat, to food hunt escapades, Allister and his buddies defy their parents' and the mouse community's rules, only to find that the consequences of their choices do not bring the pleasures for which they had hoped. In the mayhem of their struggles.

Allister also discovers that someone is watching him and has a special plan for his life. Who? The Creator! The story culminates in a review of the Gift of Christmas and Allister's understanding of his own call to serve the Creator is a very special way. This is the first of a trilogy.
