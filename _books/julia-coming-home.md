---

Determined to make a new life for herself after her parent’s untimely death, Julia quits her executive job in Portland, Oregon, adopts two miniature schnauzers named Frick and Frack and moves to Sage Meadows, a touristy western town in the Cascades.

Julia is motivated to review her life after a phrase in her mother’s obituary describing her as the “sole survivor” of the Remington family. She is shaken to realize she is thirty-nine, single, and childless; not having accomplished any of her childhood dreams. It’s true that she has had success in her career, but at what costs?

Her arrival in Sage Meadows (a town which may or may not look suspiciously like Sisters, Oregon in real life) is the first step in reaching long-forgotten wishes with her goal being to establish a “family” of some sort in the little community, maybe even find a man. However, her world becomes inexplicably complicated when she unknowingly entangles herself with the burial of a serial killer’s latest victim.

Old secrets rise to haunt her and  she wonders what God is doing. As she submits to His lead she finds woven into her life incidents that are more wonderful, and more terrifying, than she could have imagined.
